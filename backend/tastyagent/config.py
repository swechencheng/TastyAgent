"""Configuration: trading mode, strategy parameters, and risk limits.

All tunable thresholds live here so the *rules* stay fixed while their *parameters*
can adapt and be backtested. This module is intentionally stdlib-only so the
safety-critical strategy/risk core is importable and testable without any
third-party dependencies. Environment/.env loading lives in ``settings.py``.
