"""Per-strategy ahead-of-pace profit-taking schedule.

TastyTrade research gives, per strategy, the *average days held* to reach each
profit milestone. We use these as an **ahead-of-pace exit trigger**: close a
winner the instant its current profit reaches a milestone AT OR FASTER than the
table's average-days for that milestone (reaching a target ahead of schedule is
the favorable signal to lock the win in).

This can only ever close a trade *earlier* than the standard backstops
(manage-at-50%, 21-DTE) handled in ``exits.py`` — it never holds past them.
