# IBTastyAgent

An autonomous AI options-trading agent implementing **tastytrade's premium-selling methodology** executed directly via a local **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Gateway / TWS** using [`ib_async`](https://github.com/ib-api-reloaded/ib_async). Deterministic tastytrade mechanics act as unyielding guardrails; an OpenRouter LLM (default: `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`) provides an adaptive selection and sizing layer _within_ those rails.

The agent features native IBKR Market Scanner universe discovery, 1-year historical Implied Volatility (IV) Rank calculation with daily SQLite caching, spread-protective walk-the-book order execution, pre-attached 50% Take-Profit GTC limit orders, strict position isolation (so other portfolio positions are never affected), and a real-time Next.js dashboard.

> ⚠️ **Educational project. Not financial advice.** Options trading involves substantial risk. Test thoroughly in paper trading. Only point it at real capital once you fully understand the mechanics and accept the risks.

### Phase-by-Phase Code Architecture

1. **Universe Discovery via Market Scanner (`backend/tastyagent/ibkr/scanner.py`)**:
   - Executes `reqScannerDataAsync(ScannerSubscription(instrument="STK", locationCode="STK.US.MAJOR", scanCode="OPT_VOLUME_MOST_ACTIVE"))`.
   - Discovers top high-volume, liquid optionable tickers on the market dynamically, replacing static third-party watchlists.
2. **1-Year Historical IV Metrics (`backend/tastyagent/ibkr/metrics.py`)**:
   - Queries IBKR historical market data via `reqHistoricalDataAsync(contract, durationStr="1 Y", barSizeSetting="1 day", whatToShow="OPTION_IMPLIED_VOLATILITY")`.
   - Computes:
     - **IV Rank**:
       $$
       \text{IV Rank} = \frac{\text{Current IV} - \text{Min IV}_{52w}}{\text{Max IV}_{52w} - \text{Min IV}_{52w}}
       $$
     - **IV Percentile**:
       $$
       \text{IV Percentile} = \frac{\sum \mathbf{1}(\text{IV}_t < \text{Current IV})}{N}
       $$
   - Caches calculated metrics into a local SQLite table (`iv_metrics_cache`) with a daily TTL `(symbol, cache_date)` to avoid redundant gateway requests.
3. **Option Chain Resolution & Greeks Streaming (`backend/tastyagent/ibkr/marketdata.py`)**:
   - Fetches underlying spot prices using real-time quotes with automatic fallback to historical daily closes (`reqHistoricalDataAsync`) for non-subscribed exchanges.
   - Resolves active expiration dates and strike grids via `reqSecDefOptParamsAsync`.
   - Discovers option contracts matching the ~45 DTE target and streams Greeks (Delta, Theta, Implied Volatility, Bid, Ask) via generic tick 106 (`reqMktData`).
4. **Candidate Generation & Hard Guardrails (`backend/tastyagent/strategy/candidates.py`, `guardrails.py`)**:
   - Builds candidate structures: Short Strangles, Naked Puts, Put/Call Credit Spreads, and Iron Condors.
   - Enforces deterministic tastytrade rules:
     - Expiration: 30–55 DTE (target 45 DTE).
     - Delta: short legs targeted near 16Δ (max allowable delta cap).
     - Liquidity: bid-ask spread width ratio $\le 10\%$ ($\le 50\%$ in sandbox).
     - Minimum IV Rank: $\ge 30\%$.
     - Earnings Blackout: eliminates underlyings announcing earnings within 7 days.
5. **Adaptive LLM Selection (`backend/tastyagent/decision/llm.py`)**:
   - Formats qualifying candidates and macro regime data into structured JSON.
   - Prompts OpenRouter (default: `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`) to pick the best risk-adjusted setups and assign capital allocations with clear reasoning.
6. **Post-LLM Re-Validation & Portfolio Sizing (`backend/tastyagent/strategy/sizing.py`, `backend/tastyagent/risk/limits.py`)**:
   - Prevents prompt injection or hallucination: every trade chosen by the LLM is re-verified against guardrails, single-trade buying power caps (max 25%), total portfolio allocation (max 40%), daily loss limits, and consecutive loss halts.
7. **Order Execution & Spread Protection (`backend/tastyagent/ibkr/orders.py`, `backend/tastyagent/ibkr/placer.py`)**:
   - Constructs multi-leg IBKR `BAG` combo contracts (`ComboLeg`).
   - Sells credit spreads/strangles using negative limit prices (`action="BUY"`, `lmtPrice = -credit_per_share`).
   - Employs **walk-the-book** limit repricing starting at favorable mid-price, stepping by 1¢ every N seconds towards natural market price to prevent market-maker gouging.
   - Uses **cancel-and-replace** rather than in-place order modification to eliminate IBKR Warning 105 errors.
   - Auto-attaches a 50% Take-Profit GTC limit order (`action="SELL"`, `lmtPrice = -0.50 * credit_per_share`) upon fill.
8. **Position Lifecycle Management & Strict Isolation (`backend/tastyagent/execution/exit_manager.py`, `backend/tastyagent/portfolio/ledger.py`)**:
   - **Isolation**: Tags all orders and positions with unique identifiers: `orderRef="TastyAgent_{trade_id}"`. The agent never touches or interferes with manual positions or trades from other strategies on the account.
   - **Audit**: Continuously audits open IBTastyAgent positions; if any position lacks an active take-profit order, an alert is surfaced immediately.
   - **Defense**: Monitors positions at 21 DTE for standard rolling, or rolls the untested side when a short strike is breached.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** and **Node.js 20+**
- **Interactive Brokers Gateway or TWS** running locally or on your local network:
  - API enabled in Gateway/TWS settings (_Settings → API → Settings → Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients_).
  - Socket Port configured (default: `4002` for Paper, `4001` for Live).
  - Trusted IP: ensure `127.0.0.1` (or your client host IP) is added to trusted IP addresses.
- **OpenRouter API Key** (for adaptive trade selection; default model: `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`).

## Testing

The codebase includes an extensive automated test suite with full mocks for IBKR and LLM interactions:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest -q
```

All 118 unit tests validate guardrails, sizing, IBKR order generation, combo pricing mechanics, walk-the-book repricing, take-profit attachment, and risk limits.
